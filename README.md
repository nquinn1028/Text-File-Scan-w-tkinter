# Text-File-Scan-w-tkinter
The program was written with the intent of scanning multiple ASCII input files, obtaining 
necessary information to proceed, prompting the user for certain input, and producing the 
desired output. This was eventually done with a GUI that was developed using tkinter. Per 
my work rules, I am not allowed to release the full source code. However, this does serve 
as a framework for developing a similar task. All that is needed is to modify the scanning 
of the ASCII files (r any other input filew type) to identify thhhe information of interest. 
I also eventually converted the code into an executable GUI as my work has no need for the 
users too access the source code.
